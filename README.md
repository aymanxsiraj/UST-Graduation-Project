The Clinic Booking App aims to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments for patients in a fast and efficient manner. The app provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to browse through a list of doctors and clinics by specialty and location, view available appointment times, and easily book the most suitable time. Users can also check ratings from previous patients, review the services offered, receive reminder notifications for their appointments, and manage their appointments by modifying or canceling them if necessary. This app helps reduce waiting times and provides a smooth experience for both patients and doctors, while ensuring the security and confidentiality of user data. In this research, we designed and developed an Android-based clinic booking app to simplify the booking process and address the issues of traditional systems. We followed an analytical and descriptive approach based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) for analysis, and used XML to design and describe the system interfaces. The system functions were programmed using Java within the Android Studio environment, while the database was designed on the Firebase platform and integrated with the system to create a comprehensive solution to the problems of traditional systems
